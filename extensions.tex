\matthias{How does ProB add HO, and what can we learn from them (and vice-versa)}
In this section, we compile a list of missing language constructs, and introduce possible ways of implementing them and ways to learn from eachother.
\subsection{Language}
HO is sometimes criticized as being to expressive.
Sometimes however, the additional structure HO exhibits allows solvers to perform better.
For example, in this case HO preserves the local coherence and independence of the different examples, a property that the solver could leverage to become more efficient
