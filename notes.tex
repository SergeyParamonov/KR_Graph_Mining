Many problems are inherently higher order due to their complex nature and composite structure. 
From a KR perspective modeling these problems in an intu\"itive way is a challenging task. 
In this paper we study the graph mining problem as an example of a higher order problem. 
We start from its mathematical definition which is clearly higher order. 
Having identified the higher order aspects, we discuss how we model the graph mining model 
in state-of-the art KR systems (IDP and ASP) that have no support for higher order can model these problems using encoding techniques such as the disjoint union technique and the saturation technique. 

From a KR perspective, these techniques come with a considerable loss of declarativeness and clarity of the specification. 
We identify the desirable properties that from a KR perspective should hold for a good modeling of the graph mining problem. 
We evaluate how a modeling in ProB (a higher order KR language with support for sets) satisfies these properties. 
Next, we make a comparison of the performance of the three approaches.

We also propose a faithful encoding for IDP-like specification languages, which follows closely the mathematical definition of the graph mining problem and satisfies all different desired properties.
Based on this faithfull encoding,  we propose solver extensions that would shift the burden of rewriting the specification using the identified encoding techniques from the user to the solver itself, or would eliminate the need entirely.

%Many problems are inherently higher order due to their complex nature and composite structure.
%Modeling these problems in an intu\"itive way becomes a challenging task.
%This paper analyses, from a KR perspective, what difficulties arise when modeling such a problem, using the graph mining problem as an application-based example.
%We summarize several techniques such as the disjoint union technique or the saturation technique, and show how they can be applied to tackle the difficulties of modeling higher order problems, although it comes with a considerable loss of declarativeness and clarity of the specification.

%Furthermore, we identify several properties which should hold for a good modeling of the graph mining problem, from a KR perspective, and evaluate working models in several KR languages (IDP, ASP, ProB) on these properties.
%We also propose a ``faithfull'' encoding, which closely follows the mathematical definition of the graph mining problem and satisfies all different desired properties.
%Based on this faithfull encoding, we propose solver extensions that would shift the burden of rewriting the specification using the identified encoding techniques from the user to the solver itself, or would eliminate the need entirely.
