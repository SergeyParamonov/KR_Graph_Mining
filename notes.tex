%Many problems are inherently higher order due to their complex nature and composite structure.
Many problems, especially those with a composite structure, can naturally be expressed in higher order logic. %, for example due to their composite nature.
From a KR perspective modeling these problems in an intuitive way is a challenging task.
In this paper we study the graph mining problem as an example of a higher order problem. 
In short, this problem asks us to find a graph that frequently occurs as a subgraph among a set of example graphs.
We start from the problem's mathematical definition 
%which is clearly higher order 
to solve it
%the graph mining problem 
in three state-of-the-art specification systems.
%, IDP, ASP and ProB.
For IDP and ASP, which have no
native support for higher order logic, we propose the use of encoding
techniques such as the disjoint union technique and the saturation technique.
%The model in 
ProB
%, a formal specification language, 
benefits
from the higher order support for sets.
We compare the performance of the three approaches to get an idea of
the overhead of the higher order support.

%From a KR modeling perspective, we identify a number of desirable
%properties and discuss how the three approaches deal with them.
We propose higher-order language extensions for IDP-like
specification languages
and  discuss what kind of solver support is needed.
Native higher order shifts the burden of rewriting specifications using encoding techniques from the user to the solver itself.
%Many problems are inherently higher order due to their complex nature and composite structure.
%Modeling these problems in an intu\"itive way becomes a challenging task.
%This paper analyses, from a KR perspective, what difficulties arise when modeling such a problem, using the graph mining problem as an application-based example.
%We summarize several techniques such as the disjoint union technique or the saturation technique, and show how they can be applied to tackle the difficulties of modeling higher order problems, although it comes with a considerable loss of declarativeness and clarity of the specification.

%Furthermore, we identify several properties which should hold for a good modeling of the graph mining problem, from a KR perspective, and evaluate working models in several KR languages (IDP, ASP, ProB) on these properties.
%We also propose a ``faithfull'' encoding, which closely follows the mathematical definition of the graph mining problem and satisfies all different desired properties.
%Based on this faithfull encoding, we propose solver extensions that would shift the burden of rewriting the specification using the identified encoding techniques from the user to the solver itself, or would eliminate the need entirely.

%This paper analyses how problems of a composite and complex nature
