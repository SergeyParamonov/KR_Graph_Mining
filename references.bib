	abstract = {We present a new approach towards solving quantifiedBoolean formulas (QBFs) using nested SAT solvers with lazyclause generation. The approach has been implemented ontop of the Glucose solver by adding mechanisms for nestingsolvers as well as clause learning. Our preliminary experiments show that nested SAT solving performs (out of the box)relatively well on QBF, when taking into account that no particular QBF-oriented solving techniques were incorporated.The most important contribution of this work is that it provides a systematic way of lifting advances in SAT solvers toQBFs with low implementation effort.},

and Ottosson, G.",
title="Logic-based Benders decomposition",
journal="Mathematical Programming",
volume="96",
number="1",
pages="33--60",
abstract="\enspaceBenders decomposition uses a strategy of ``learning from one's mistakes.'' The aim of this paper is to extend this strategy to a much larger class of problems. The key is to generalize the linear programming dual used in the classical method to an ``inference dual.'' Solution of the inference dual takes the form of a logical deduction that yields Benders cuts. The dual is therefore very different from other generalized duals that have been proposed. The approach is illustrated by working out the details for propositional satisfiability and 0-1 programming problems. Computational tests are carried out for the latter, but the most promising contribution of logic-based Benders may be to provide a framework for combining optimization and constraint programming methods.",
